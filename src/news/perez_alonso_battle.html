          Perez found ‘intense’ battle with Alonso ‘super enjoyable’ despite

            Sergio Perez missed out on a top three finish in Sao Paulo by just
            0.053s, as Fernando Alonso pipped him in a drag race across the
            finishing line. It was the perfect end to an epic battle that had
            been going on for many laps between the Red Bull and the Aston
            Martin.
          </p>
          <p class="card-text-news">
            Lap 48 was when Perez first found himself directly behind the Aston
            Martin on track, but it took a few laps for the Mexican to close the
            gap with both drivers on soft tyres for their final stint. Alonso
            had the advantage of having pitted one lap later for fresh rubber,
            Perez having bolted on three-lap old softs at his final stop.
          </p>
          <p class="card-text-news">
            It took until Lap 54 for Perez to get into DRS range of Alonso
            ahead, and the Mexican soon went for a move into Turn 1. But Alonso
            knew he was coming and took a wider line to cut back across the
            apex, preventing his rival from squeezing down the inside. That was
            the status quo for lap after lap, Perez harrying and Alonso
            defending for all he was worth.
          </p>
          <p class="card-text-news">
            But on the penultimate lap, the Mexican finally found a way past
            into Turn 1, and managed to almost break the DRS to ensure Alonso
            couldn’t return the favour into Turn 4. The Spaniard admitted that
            he thought his chance of a podium had gone, only for Perez to brake
            a fraction too late into Turn 1 on the final lap, giving Alonso a
            run into Turn 4 where he retook the position.
          </p>
          <p class="card-text-news">
            The two then had a drag race across the line, Alonso shading it by
            the barest of margins.
          </p>
          <p class="card-text-news">
            “I mean it was a great fight with Fernando, I don’t think with a lot
            of drivers you can do these kinds of manoeuvers,” Perez said
            afterwards. “It was really tight from beginning to end, it was super
            enjoyable to be honest, I did have a lot of fun. In the end he ended
            up getting the podium, but it is how the sport is.
          </p>
          <p class="card-text-news">
            “I think we had a great fight, very fair and to the limit. I think
            this is something a lot of drivers can learn from, what we did, the
            way we fight today, I think it’s something – it’s how it should be
            done. I’m in the wrong side, I ended up losing but it’s fine because
            it was a great fight.”
          </p>
          <p class="card-text-news">
            Perez’s wait for a first podium since Monza continues, but he did
            finish in the top three in Saturday’s Sprint and was able to fully
            extract the pace from the RB19 in what was a fairly successful
            weekend for the Mexican – which gave him plenty to be pleased with.
          </p>
          <p class="card-text-news">
            “We’ve seen in the last couple of races that the pace has been
            there, that we’ve been really strong but for some reason or another,
            we haven’t been able to get the end result. But I just knew it was a
            matter of time.”
          </p>
          <p class="card-text-news">
            Team boss Christian Horner called it “a big drive” when he radioed
            his congratulations after Perez took the flag, saying his driver
            “gave it everything.”
          </p>
          <p class="card-text-news">
            With Lewis Hamilton struggling, Perez has increased his advantage in
            the fight for second in the drivers’ championship, with Red Bull
            never having managed a 1-2 finish in their history.
