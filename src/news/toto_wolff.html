          ‘Inexcusable performance’ – Wolff brands Mercedes’ W14 ‘miserable’ as
          car ‘doesn’t deserve a win’

            Toto Wolff has labelled Mercedes’ W14 “miserable” following an
            “inexcusable performance” at the Sao Paulo Grand Prix.
          </p>
          <p class="card-text-news">
            After successive runner-up finishes at the last two Grands Prix –
            albeit with his Austin P2 result later resulting in disqualification
            – Lewis Hamilton could only claim a lowly P8 in Brazil, while team
            mate George Russell was forced to retire.
          </p>
          <p class="card-text-news">
            Hamilton had lined up fifth for the race, and made a great start to
            find himself running third in the early stages, but he soon dropped
            to fourth following the restart – after Alex Albon and Kevin
            Magnussen’s crash – when Fernando Alonso passed him.
          </p>
          <p class="card-text-news">
            That downward trajectory continued for the seven-time world
            champion, with Sergio Perez overtaking him a few laps later. In the
            end eighth was as good as it got, with Lance Stroll, Carlos Sainz
            and Pierre Gasly all finishing ahead in what was a bitter blow
            following recent green shoots of optimism.
          </p>
          <p class="card-text-news">
            Though Russell was forced to retire on lap 59 of the race, his pace
            had also been faltering through the Grand Prix, and Team Principal
            Wolff summed up the mood at Mercedes with a damning assessment of
            the team’s 2023 car.
          </p>
          <p class="card-text-news">
            “Inexcusable performance,” he told Sky Sports following the race.
            “There’s not even words for that. That car finished second last
            week, and the week before, and whatever we did to it was horrible.”
          </p>
          <p class="card-text-news">
            “Lewis survived out there but George… I can only feel for the two
            driving such a miserable thing. It shows how difficult the car is,
            it’s on a knife edge.”
          </p>
          <p class="card-text-news">
            “We’ve got to develop that better for next year because it can’t be
            that within seven days you’re finishing on the podium – solid, one
            of the two quickest cars – and then we finish eighth.”
          </p>
          <p class="card-text-news">
            With the inquest sure to begin rapidly as to why the W14 was so off
            the pace out in Brazil, Wolff and everyone else will be desperate to
            understand the reasons behind its inconsistency – particularly with
            the 2024 season rapidly approaching.
          </p>
          <p class="card-text-news">
            “Yeah, we’re clearly not world champions on Sprint race weekends, we
            do some good work here on track to get it done but still it doesn’t
            explain what went wrong,” Wolff said when asked if the Sprint format
            might be a factor. “That car almost drove like it was on three
            wheels and not on four.”
          </p>
          <p class="card-text-news">
            There is also little love lost towards this season’s Mercedes
            machinery. While last year’s troublesome W13 managed one victory
            during the season at Interlagos, Wolff was in no doubt as to whether
            the team’s 2023 offering deserved a Grand Prix victory to its name.
          </p>
          <p class="card-text-news">
            “This car doesn’t deserve a win,” he said. “We need to push for the
            last two races and recover. I think that’s the most important thing
            and see what we can do in Las Vegas – a totally different track –
            and Abu Dhabi. But the performance today was… I’m just lacking
            words.”
          </p>
          <p class="card-text-news">
            He added: “I think straight-line speed was one issue but probably
            not the main factor [in Brazil]. The main factor was that we
            couldn’t go around the corners with the bigger wing, with the pace
            we needed, and we were killing the tyres – just eating them up
            within a few laps.”
          </p>
          <p class="card-text-news">
            With just two races remaining of the 2023 campaign, many of the
            learnings made at this stage will help to inform Mercedes of where
            they are in the hope of challenging Red Bull next year.
          </p>
          <p class="card-text-news">
            There’s also the matter of securing P2 in the constructors’
            championship, with Ferrari 20 points behind them in third, though
            Mercedes were undoubtedly aided by Charles Leclerc being unable to
            start the Grand Prix after spinning out on the formation lap in Sao
            Paulo.
          </p>
          <p class="card-text-news">
            Hamilton’s bid for P2 in the drivers’ standings also lost momentum
            with Sergio Perez’s P4 in Brazil extending the gap. The Red Bull man
            now leads Hamilton by 32 points with the constructor’s champions
            hoping to seal their first ever 1-2 in the drivers’ championship.
