          Lambiase reveals his ‘biggest fear’ about Verstappen relationship
          going forward

            Max Verstappen and his race engineer Gianpiero Lambiase have forged
            a formidable partnership during their time together at Red Bull –
            but the journey to title-winning glory has not been without some
            bumps in the road.
          </p>
          <p class="card-text-news">
            Verstappen and Lambiase joined forces a handful of races into the
            2016 season, when the Dutch teenager was promoted to Red Bull in
            place of Daniil Kvyat and spectacularly won on his debut for the
            team at the Spanish Grand Prix.
          </p>
          <p class="card-text-news">
            After several seasons of watching on as Mercedes wrapped up
            back-to-back titles, Verstappen and Red Bull finally emerged as
            championship contenders in 2021, narrowly beating Lewis Hamilton to
            that year’s crown before storming clear in 2022 and 2023.
          </p>
          <p class="card-text-news">
            However, despite the recent dominance under F1’s latest ground
            effect era, Verstappen and Lambiase have been involved in several
            heated radio exchanges in recent times, prompting plenty of
            questions from the media about their relationship.
          </p>
          <p class="card-text-news">
            Appearing together on Red Bull’s Talking Bull podcast, Verstappen
            and Lambiase tackled the topic head on, with the latter serving up
            an amusing comment to kick things off.
          </p>
          <p class="card-text-news">
            “My biggest fear is the moment that we do have increased competition
            and we’re not winning every race, because you see how he’s treating
            me at the moment – and he’s winning every race!” Lambiase smiled,
            also prompting a laugh from Verstappen.
          </p>
          <p class="card-text-news">
            Offering a more serious take on the situation as the conversation
            developed, Verstappen argued that “something is wrong” if there are
            not occasional moments of frustration in his and Lambiase’s quest
            for success.
          </p>
          <p class="card-text-news">
            “I mean, I still get upset, even in such a dominant season, when
            things don’t go well, and it’s the same for GP,” he commented.
          </p>
          <p class="card-text-news">
            “We still want to win, we still want to do everything as perfect as
            we can, even though no one is perfect, but we try to be as close to
            perfection as possible. That’s why sometimes, of course, we still
            have our arguments, but it’s all because we are very driven to
            win...
          </p>
          <p class="card-text-news">
            “When we come out of the weekend, we say how we could have done
            things better, or quite a bit better. You know, it still upsets us,
            which I think is good because if you don’t have that drive, then I
            think something is wrong.”
          </p>
          <p class="card-text-news">
            Given how much they have already achieved together, Lambiase and
            Verstappen also opened up about the key factors behind their
            successful working relationship on and off the track.
          </p>
          <p class="card-text-news">
            “I don’t think it’s a real secret, but you just need to get on
            really well, you need to understand what you want from each other,”
            explained Verstappen.
          </p>
          <p class="card-text-news">
            “I think nowadays, we really grew in our role as well I guess, but I
            almost don’t need to even say anything… After I say I have a bit of
            understeer or oversteer, GP knows what he will change on the car for
            me, the way I drive the car as well, and that takes time.
          </p>
          <p class="card-text-news">
            “That’s why I would always be against changing race engineers or
            performance engineers – they’re very crucial in your performance.
            The longer you can stay together, the better, because you will
            really be one and one.”
          </p>
          <p class="card-text-news">
            Describing Verstappen as his “little brother”, Lambiase added: “I
            think what’s really important is just to be able to be yourself. I
            think Max feels he can be himself with me, I can be myself around
            him, and there’s no tiptoeing around any issues at all.
          </p>

          <p class="card-text-news">
            “If we have to be blunt about something with each other, we will be,
            and I think that just fast-tracks you to short-term gains, which
            ultimately is maximising the potential of the car during a race
            weekend.”
