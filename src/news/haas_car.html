      Stewards to consider Haas ‘Right of Review’ request over US Grand Prix

        United States Grand Prix stewards are to consider a request from the Haas
        team for a Right of Review of the Austin race results in relation to track
        limit infringements, including those by Williams’ Alex Albon.
      </p>
      <p class="card-text-news">
        Albon, who finished in ninth place at the Circuit of The Americas,
        was reported to the stewards during the race for allegedly leaving the track
        without a justifiable reason multiple times in Turn 6.
        However, no further action was taken as it was deemed there was insufficient proof.
      </p>
      <p class="card-text-news">
        “Based on the video footage available (which did not include CCTV), the Stewards determine,
        whilst there might be some indication for possible track limit infringements in Turn 6,
        the evidence at hand is not sufficient to accurately and consistently conclude that any breaches occurred,
        ” read the stewards’ document at the time.
      </p>
      <p class="card-text-news">
        Now, a two-part hearing will commence on Wednesday, with the first part to hear evidence
        as to whether there is a “significant and relevant new element which was unavailable to the party
        seeking the Review at the time of the Decision concerned.”
      </p>
      <p class="card-text-news">
        Should the stewards determine that such an element exists,
        a second part of the hearing will be convened at a later date.
        As well as Haas and Williams, Red Bull and Aston Martin have also been called to attend the hearing.
      </p>
      <p class="card-text-news">
        Haas driver Nico Hulkenberg narrowly missed out on the points in Austin.
        After the disqualifications of Charles Leclerc and Lewis Hamilton, the German was classified 11th,
        having taken the flag less than two seconds behind the second Williams of Logan Sargeant.
      </p>
      <p class="card-text-news">
        With two rounds of the season remaining,
        Haas lie 10th and last in the constructors’ championship on 12 points,
        four behind ninth-placed Alfa Romeo.
