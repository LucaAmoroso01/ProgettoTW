          Winners and Losers from Sao Paulo – Who left Interlagos the happiest

            Max Verstappen extended his record of most wins in a season to 17.
            But while there was joy for the Dutchman, there was frustration for
            others, not least those caught up in the opening lap melee.
          </p>
          <h5 class="winner-loser">Winner: Max Verstappen</h5>
          <p class="card-text-news">
            There is just no stopping the Dutchman in 2023. He grabbed the win
            in Saturday’s Sprint, and then dominated from pole in the Grand Prix
            to chalk up an incredible 17th win out of the 20 races so far this
            year.
          </p>
          <p class="card-text-news">
            Having long since wrapped up the title, he’s showing no signs of
            taking his foot off the gas – much to the dismay of the rest. He
            nailed the two standing starts in the Grand Prix, and only conceded
            the lead once during the second pit stop period.
          </p>
          <p class="card-text-news">
            His 52nd career win moved him into fourth and past Alain Prost in
            the all-time list, and the way he’s driving, you’d be hard-pressed
            to bet against him recording more victories with two races to go.
          </p>
          <h5 class="winner-loser">Loser: Charles Leclerc</h5>
          <p class="card-text-news">
            What does Charles Leclerc have to do to get a sliver of luck this
            season? He had qualified well and was due to start second on the
            grid, one of the few front runners to have a fresh set of softs to
            play with. But disaster struck before the race even started,
            technical issues causing him to spin out on the Formation Lap.
          </p>
          <p class="card-text-news">
            The Monegasque driver cut a disconsolate figure as first he put his
            head in his hands, before lamenting on the radio as to why he was
            “so ******* unlucky.” He then sat on the barriers, totally downcast
            before finally making his way back to the Ferrari garage.
          </p>
          <p class="card-text-news">
            It’s the second time he hasn’t scored in the last three races, to
            add to his disqualification from Austin. It would be a very, very
            small consolation that he did at least pick up a few points in the
            Sprint.
          </p>
          <h5 class="winner-loser">Winner: Lando Norris</h5>
          <p class="card-text-news">
            Lando Norris has been left a tad frustrated with some small mistakes
            in qualifying at the last few race weekends, and wasn’t too happy
            with his starting slot for Sunday’s Grand Prix. But he put that
            right by grabbing pole for the Sprint, coming home second after
            acknowledging that he didn’t have the pace to fight Verstappen.
          </p>
          <p class="card-text-news">
            On Sunday, a brilliant start from sixth on the grid launched him up
            to second, where he was the only driver able to stay within touching
            distance of the lead Red Bull. It might not be the win he so craves,
            but a fifth podium in six Grands Prix and another Driver of the Day
            accolade is still a pretty handy return.
          </p>
          <h5 class="winner-loser">Losers: Mercedes</h5>
          <p class="card-text-news">
            Mercedes performed strongly in Brazil last year, and many favoured
            them to do likewise, believing this was their best chance of a
            victory this season. But their pace was non-existent in the Sprint,
            with both Lewis Hamilton and George Russell struggling with tyre
            wear.
          </p>
          <p class="card-text-news">
            They had hoped to rectify that for the Grand Prix, but suffered the
            same issues on Sunday. Both drivers found themselves going
            backwards, with reliability also an issue for George Russell, who
            retired with ‘high and worsening PU oil temperatures.’
          </p>
          <p class="card-text-news">
            Hamilton eventually came home eighth, after complaining that he
            couldn’t keep up with Pierre Gasly’s Alpineeven with the help of
            DRS. He joked afterwards that he was looking forward to never
            driving the W14 again, while Toto Wolff went further, branding the
            race an “inexcusable performance.”
          </p>
          <h5 class="winner-loser">Winners: Aston Martin</h5>
          <p class="card-text-news">
            After a late-season slump that saw their speed completely disappear,
            not to mention reliability concerns rear up, Aston Martin were back
            on form in Brazil. They abandoned the upgraded floor that caused
            them so many difficulties in Austin to lock-out the second row of
            the grid for the Grand Prix.
          </p>
          <p class="card-text-news">
            Both Fernando Alonso and Lance Stroll drove superb races to come
            home third and fifth, but it was the Spaniard’s late, incredible
            defence against the Red Bull of Sergio Perez that was the highlight
            of the weekend for the team in green.
          </p>
          <p class="card-text-news">
            Alonso took his first podium since Zandvoort and eighth of the
            season by a hair’s breadth from the Red Bull, after retaking third
            place on the very last lap. It was the sort of drive that will be
            remembered for a long time, and shows that age is no barrier to
            performance for the veteran world champion.
          </p>
          <h5 class="winner-loser">Loser: Alex Albon</h5>
          <p class="card-text-news">
            Alex Albon made a great getaway from 13th on the grid, one of the
            best of anyone he believed at the time. He was on the cusp of the
            points paying positions, but found himself the innocent bystander as
            Nico Hulkenberg tagged his rear, sending him careering into the
            sister Haas of Kevin Magnussen.
          </p>
          <p class="card-text-news">
            He crashed heavily, and as well as a hefty repair bill likely to hit
            Williams hard so close to the end of the season, there were no
            points for the team on a day where Albon felt he had the pace for
            the top 10.
          </p>
          <h5 class="winner-loser">Winner: Yuki Tsunoda</h5>
          <p class="card-text-news">
            Yuki Tsunoda put some Friday qualifying frustrations to one side by
            grabbing sixth on the gridfor the Sprint and converting that into
            more points for AlphaTauri. But he did even better on Sunday,
            climbing back through the field on a day the car obviously had
            decent pace to secure ninth at the flag.
          </p>
          <p class="card-text-news">
            His five-point haul from the weekend reduces the gap to Williams to
            just seven-points in the fight for seventh in the constructors’, an
            incredible turnaround for the team who had been rock bottom of the
            standings all season until Mexico. And with Daniel Ricciardo also
            saying his car had great pace, AlphaTauri must feel confident of
            running Williams pretty close with just two races to go.
          </p>
          <h5 class="winner-loser">Losers: Alfa Romeo</h5>
          <p class="card-text-news">
            Alfa Romeo went into the weekend confident of a good result at a
            track where Valtteri Bottas has done well at in the past. But
            instead, they recorded their first double DNF of the season on
            Sunday, as they left with no points for the third race weekend in a
            row.
          </p>
          <p class="card-text-news">
            The team would only say it was a technical issue that caused the
            retirements, confirming it was not the same issue on both cars.
            Having lost so much ground to AlphaTauri in the constructors’
            championship, they can ill afford reliability issues this late in
            the season.
