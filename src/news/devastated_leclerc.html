          ‘Why am I so unlucky?’ – Leclerc left devastated by formation lap
          failure in Brazil

            It wasn’t to be for Charles Leclerc in Brazil, the Ferrari driver
            suffering a mechanical failure on the formation lap that ultimately
            took him out of the race.
          </p>
          <p class="card-text-news">
            Initially, as he spun off into the barriers when following eventual
            race-winner Max Verstappen around Interlagos, it looked like Leclerc
            might recover back to the pits and be able to start the race – but
            he soon parked up down an escape road with an engine issue to go
            with his broken front wing and wounded pride.
          </p>
          <p class="card-text-news">
            It's been a desperate season for Ferrari, who had hoped to challenge
            Red Bull for the title, as they did in the early stages of last
            year. Instead, they have a handful of poles and just the one race
            win to their name for 2023, and that was achieved by Leclerc’s team
            mate in Singapore.
          </p>
          <p class="card-text-news">
            For the Monegasque, this latest failure was another blow in what has
            been an incredibly tough season. Starting from second on the grid
            and one of the few front runners still to have some fresh soft tyres
            in his locker, he had hoped to have a strong race. Instead, it all
            unravelled before the lights had even gone out.
          </p>
          <p class="card-text-news">
            “I turned into Turn 6, everything was fine and then as you can see,
            I basically lose the wheel because there is no power steering
            anymore, the steering wheel feels extremely stiff, then I go
            straight,” he said afterwards.
          </p>
          <p class="card-text-news">
            “Then the engine stopped for safety reasons, which made the rear
            wheels lock, which made me spin. Then I touched the wall, I started
            to start the car again, I did 20 metres then exactly the same thing
            happened. So that’s it.”
          </p>
          <p class="card-text-news">
            Leclerc’s anguish was clear to see, the Monegasque driver holding
            his head in his hands in the cockpit. “Why the **** am I so unlucky,
            why the **** am I so unlucky?” he repeated down the radio to his
            race engineer, before climbing out of his cockpit and sitting on the
            wall, head bowed.
          </p>
          <p class="card-text-news">
            “I don’t know, I don’t know, I don’t know what to do anymore,” he
            said when he spoke to the media while the race was still continuing.
          </p>
          <p class="card-text-news">
            “It’s been a season to forget, there’s been quite a few races where
            I felt I was on it and then for some reason or other, it wasn’t the
            result I wanted on Sunday and today is part of them, so of course,
            the frustration is big today.”
          </p>
          <p class="card-text-news">
            “It’s like this now, I need to get over it and focus on the last two
            races which are still important. I cannot wait [for] it to be next
            year.”
          </p>
          <p class="card-text-news">
            In the fight for second in the constructors’, Carlos Sainz did at
            least out-score Mercedes in the race by coming home sixth ahead of
            Lewis Hamilton in eighth, which means Ferrari trail the Silver
            Arrows by 20 points going into the final two races of the season.
