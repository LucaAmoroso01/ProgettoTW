          ‘Close to perfect weekend’ for Norris as he grabs fifth podium in six
          races

            Lando Norris shot off the line to launch himself past both Aston
            Martins into second at the first corner, and from there, never
            looked back.
          </p>
          <p class="card-text-news">
            While he didn’t manage to put too much pressure on Max Verstappen
            for the race lead, Norris kept the Dutchman honest throughout and
            snatched his fifth podium from the last six races, or his seventh
            top-three if you include the Sprints.
          </p>
          <p class="card-text-news">
            There have been occasional errors during those events which Norris
            has been up front about, which is why it was good to see the smiling
            Briton concede that on balance, this weekend was pretty good.
          </p>
          <p class="card-text-news">
            “This has been a close to perfect weekend, close, not quite, but as
            close as it gets,” he said afterwards. “I just got a very good
            start, I did the opposite of yesterday. I mean that saved me, I
            don’t know what happened to [Leclerc], I saw he had an issue which
            was a shame as it would have been good to try and race everyone a
            little bit.
          </p>
          <p class="card-text-news">
            “But at the same time, the less people I can race the better. Yeah,
            to start and get into P2 I was like ‘ohhh we can have a tasty one
            here with Max’. I tried on my first opportunity, but I only had one
            and I couldn’t make it count. Again, like I said yesterday, it’s
            very positive to be up there, fighting in these positions, to have
            such a big gap to everyone behind us.”
          </p>
          <p class="card-text-news">
            After the second big raft of upgrades bolted onto Norris’ car in
            Singapore jumped McLaren up the order, with the team delivering
            strong showings in Japan, Qatar and Austin, the last two races in
            Mexico City and Sao Paulo were expected to reshuffle the order
            somewhat.
          </p>
          <p class="card-text-news">
            “The pace has been very strong, yeah, to be coming into a race
            weekend where we weren’t expecting to be performing quite at this
            level, I think is a very good surprise for us,” continued Norris.
          </p>
          <p class="card-text-news">
            “Here and Mexico are the two tracks we said we were going to
            struggle, and we’ve come out of them a lot better than we were
            expecting so I think it’s a big positive for the whole team and for
            myself to know this. It doesn’t seem like there are any bad tracks
            for us at the minute.”
          </p>
          <p class="card-text-news">
            With Norris just three points behind Fernando Alonso in the fightfor
            fourth in the drivers’ championship, there’s still plenty to play
            for in the last two races of the season – as he continues to hunt
            that elusive first Grand Prix victory. But he remained well aware
            that the next race in Las Vegas could either be a huge opportunity
            or a huge bump back down to earth, calling it a “question mark” for
            everyone.
          </p>
          <p class="card-text-news">
            He's knocking down the door of a win, but as he said himself when he
            crossed the line in Sao Paulo, there’s “always that one car in the
            way.”
