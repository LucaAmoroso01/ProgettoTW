          Stewards to consider Haas ‘Right of Review’ request over US Grand Prix

            United States Grand Prix stewards are to consider a request from the
            Haas team for a Right of Review of the Austin race results in
            relation to track limit infringements, including those by Williams’
            Alex Albon.
          </p>
          <p class="card-text-news">
            Albon, who finished in ninth place at the Circuit of The Americas,
            was reported to the stewards during the race for allegedly leaving
            the track without a justifiable reason multiple times in Turn 6.
            However, no further action was taken as it was deemed there was
            insufficient proof.
          </p>
          <p class="card-text-news">
            “Based on the video footage available (which did not include CCTV),
            the Stewards determine, whilst there might be some indication for
            possible track limit infringements in Turn 6, the evidence at hand
            is not sufficient to accurately and consistently conclude that any
            breaches occurred, ” read the stewards’ document at the time.
          </p>
          <p class="card-text-news">
            Now, a two-part hearing will commence on Wednesday, with the first
            part to hear evidence as to whether there is a “significant and
            relevant new element which was unavailable to the party seeking the
            Review at the time of the Decision concerned.”
          </p>
          <p class="card-text-news">
            Should the stewards determine that such an element exists, a second
            part of the hearing will be convened at a later date. As well as
            Haas and Williams, Red Bull and Aston Martin have also been called
            to attend the hearing.
          </p>
          <p class="card-text-news">
            Haas driver Nico Hulkenberg narrowly missed out on the points in
            Austin. After the disqualifications of Charles Leclerc and Lewis
            Hamilton, the German was classified 11th, having taken the flag less
            than two seconds behind the second Williams of Logan Sargeant.
          </p>
          <p class="card-text-news">
            With two rounds of the season remaining, Haas lie 10th and last in
            the constructors’ championship on 12 points, four behind
            ninth-placed Alfa Romeo.
